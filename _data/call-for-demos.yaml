overview-title: Overview
overview: |
  If you have a prototype, device, system, or exhibit thematically related to Augmented Humans, we encourage you to submit it to the Augmented Humans Demo Track. Sharing hands-on experiences of your work is a great way to stimulate discussions, gather feedback, and directly observe your work's impact on people. Demos will be presented in an interactive manner, meaning that conference attendees can directly interact with the demos while being instructed or guided through the experience by the presenting author(s).

submissions-title: Content of the Submissions
submissions: |
  Demo submissions should be up to 4 pages single column excluding references and not anonymized. They should include an abstract, an introduction to the work which motivates it and states how it contributes to research, a description of the envisioned exhibit, and a conclusion and/or discussion. The submission details and guidelines such as template, due date, and submission portal can be found at <a href="/calls-for-participation">Calls for Participation</a>.

  We specifically ask authors to detail their demo setup and encourage the addition of figures illustrating your vision of what the demonstration and the exhibit space might look like, and how audiences and participants might observe or interact with the exhibit. Moreover, demo submissions should not have been published before in a similar format (i.e., other conferences' demos or interactivity tracks). We, therefore, ask authors to indicate and reference any prior publications related to the demo in the text. Accepted demos will be published on the ACM Digital Library.

presentation-title: Presentation Format
presentation: |
  Demos will be presented in person during the conference’s demo session. This means authors will be required to transport their demonstrations to Melbourne and set up their exhibits in person at the Augmented Humans conference space. To ensure that accepted demos operate as intended during the demo session, we ask authors to bring their own devices (e.g. power/data cables) to ensure the demo runs smoothly. We also encourage the authors to include a figure or video of their demo setup and how it runs so we can arrange the most suitable setup location.


submission-files-title: Submission Files
submission-files: |
  We ask demo authors to submit the following files:
  1)	one PDF file consisting in:
  <p style="padding-left:2em;"> ➥	an up to 4 pages single column (excl. references) paper</p>
  <p style="padding-left:2em;">➥ a floor plan of their demo setup (e.g. a rough top-view sketch of your setup) which also indicates the required space in meters (i.e. length and width)</p>
  
  2)  An optional figure or video showing roughly how their demo setup looks and runs ideally
  3)	an optional teaser video, showing the demo (approx. 30 - 60 seconds)

  IMPORTANT: For Abu Dhabi and all locations within the United Arab Emirates, the standard plug type is Type G, characterized by three rectangular pins arranged in a triangular pattern. The electrical system operates on a 230V supply voltage with a frequency of 50Hz. Please bring appropriate adapters if required.


reviewing-title: Reviewing and Selection
reviewing: |
  Each demo submission will be independently reviewed by two demo chairs or external reviewers based on the following criteria:
  •	The relevance of the topics to the Augmented Humans conference
  •	The originality of the work and whether an interactive presentation is feasible
